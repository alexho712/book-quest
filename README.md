# Local to Online Expansion of BookQuest
This is a project simulating development of an online platform for the expansion of a mock local bookstore to expand its services. This project was done throughout my course in CS340 - Introduction to Databases to utilize the use of relational databases to manage and change the database efficiently. You can find out more in the pdf file that outlines the project and contains a summary of the changes and progress made throughout the project. 

Currently, the application is not being hosted but here are screen shots that display the web application and the schema for the entities and their relationships.
